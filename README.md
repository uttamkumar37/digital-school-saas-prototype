# Digital School SaaS Prototype

This repository contains the prototype for a fully digital, microservice-based School Management System (SaaS) designed for multiple schools.

---

## Project Overview

The system provides a scalable and modular architecture covering all essential digital school operations such as:

- User authentication with multi-tenant support
- Online lectures and classes management
- Digital fees and payment processing
- Event scheduling and notifications
- Role-based access for admins, teachers, students, and parents
- Support for web (React), mobile (React Native), and backend (Spring Boot with MySQL)

## Getting Started

### Backend

- Navigate to `backend/services/user-service`
- Build and run the Spring Boot application
- Configure `application.yml` for your MySQL database and JWT secrets

### Frontend

- Web: Navigate to `frontend/web-portal`
- Mobile: Navigate to `frontend/mobile-app`
- Install dependencies and run via standard React and React Native workflows

### Database

- Run SQL migration scripts from `database/migrations/`
- Load seed data as needed from `database/seed-data/`

## Future Work

- Complete implementation of all microservices
- Develop detailed frontend UI for all user roles
- Implement payment gateway integration
- Add automated tests and CI/CD pipeline
- Package as a SaaS product for multiple schools
